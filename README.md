# Bioeng-Project - Image-Based Bioengineering Data Analysis and Query
**Notes:** Originally developed at UC Irvine and hosted under my school GitHub account ([QZT168](https://github.com/QZT168)), this project is now forked to my personal GitHub for long-term access.

## Project Overview
- The project developed an automated image analysis and query tool designed to convert unstructured biological cell image data into a structured tabular format and support natural language or SQL-like queries.

## Content:
- images/: dataset images for this project.
- Bioeng-pj1.ipynb: we co-wrote the code on colab, and the ipynb file contains all versions of our code, as well as a brief introduction to the code for each part of the project.
- Bioeng-pj1.pdf: the pdf version of Bioeng-pj1.ipynb.
- Bioeng-pj1.py: all the code in the final version.
- report.pdf: this document contains our detailed introduction to the project, the thought process, the coding process, the use of tools and techniques, and future improvements.
